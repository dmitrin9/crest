# The crest testing environment.

This directory contains a set of situations for crest to test against as well as a set of features for crest to utilize in those situations (such as Crestfiles and robots files). Whenever a bug is discovered, a recreation of the bug is probably put in here. Crest is then ran against all of those test cases and if the result is not expected, an error is raised.
